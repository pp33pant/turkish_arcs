Since they cannot persuade the council committee, Meliksah gives an order to bring the leader of Anatolian Turkoman to make a statement.Meliksah’s son Muhammed Tapar (Ali Gozusirin) is assigned for this task. Sencer also accompanies his brother throughout their journey. When they arrive at the Anatolian Turkoman land, they see that their leader is a young woman Elcin (Leyla Lydia Tugutlu). Even though her father was killed by Seljuk Empire and her brother is taken captive by Seljuk Empire, Elcin does not rebel against Meliksah’s order. She does not want to go to a war and immediately accepts to appear before Meliksah to refuse assassination allegations.Elcin’s arrival to the palace changes the balances between palace women: Meliksah’s wife Terken (Hatice Sendil) who comes from a noble family; Meliksah’s mother and the chief hatun Seferiye (Cigdem Selisik Onat); and Muhammed Tapar’s wife Gevher (Leyla Feray).  Meliksah tries to do his best within the palace and at the same time, fights against “batini” group, Byzantine Empire, and fellow rival states who seek to weaken the Seljuks.Within this chaos, Sencer falls in love with Turna (Sevda Erginci) who is a successful healer at first sight.
